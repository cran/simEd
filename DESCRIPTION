Imports: graphics, grDevices, methods, stats, utils
Depends: rstream
Description: Contains various functions to be used for simulation education, 
    including queueing simulation functions, variate generation functions
    capable of producing independent streams and antithetic variates, functions
    for illustrating random variate generation for various discrete and
    continuous distributions, and functions to compute time-persistent
    statistics.  Also contains two queueing data sets (one fabricated, one
    real-world) to facilitate input modeling.
