Depends: rstream
Description: Contains various functions to be used for simulation education, 
    including simple Monte Carlo simulation functions, queueing simulation
    functions, variate generation functions capable of producing independent
    streams and antithetic variates, functions for illustrating random variate
    generation for various discrete and continuous distributions, and functions
    to compute time-persistent statistics.  Also contains two queueing data sets
    (one fabricated, one real-world) to facilitate input modeling.
