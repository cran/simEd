\title{Standard Deviation of Time-Persistent Statistics (TPS)}
\usage{
sdTPS(times = NULL, numbers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{times}{A numeric vector of non-decreasing time observations}

\item{numbers}{A numeric vector containing the values of the
time-persistent statistic between the time observation}
}
\value{
Computes the sample standard deviation of the time-persistent statistic provided.
}
\description{
Computes the sample standard deviation of a time-persistent
    statistic.
}
\details{
The lengths of \code{times} and \code{numbers} either must be
    the same, or \code{times} may have one more entry than \code{numbers}
    (interval endpoints vs. interval counts). The sample variance is the
    area under the square of the step-function created by the values in
    \code{numbers} between the first and last element in \code{times} divided
    by the length of the observation period, less the square of the sample mean.
    The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance.

\examples{
 times  <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
 counts <- c(1,2,1,1,2)
 meanTPS(times, counts)
 sdTPS(times, counts)

 output <- ssq(seed = 54321, maxTime = 1000, saveServerStatus = TRUE)
 utilization <- meanTPS(output$serverStatusT, output$serverStatusN)
 sdServerStatus <- sdTPS(output$serverStatusT, output$serverStatusN)

 # compute and graphically display mean and sd of number in system vs time
 output <- ssq(maxArrivals = 60, seed = 54321, saveAllStats = TRUE)
 plot(output$numInSystemT, output$numInSystemN, type = "s", bty = "l",
    las = 1, xlab = "time", ylab = "number in system")
 meanSys <- meanTPS(output$numInSystemT, output$numInSystemN)
 sdSys   <- sdTPS(output$numInSystemT, output$numInSystemN)
 abline(h = meanSys, lty = "solid", col = "red", lwd = 2)
 abline(h = c(meanSys - sdSys, meanSys + sdSys),
    lty = "dashed", col = "red", lwd = 2)
