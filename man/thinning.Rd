\usage{
thinning(
  maxTime = 24,
  intensityFcn = function(x) (5 - sin(x/0.955) - (4 * cos(x/3.82)))/0.5,
  majorizingFcn = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{maxTime}{maximum time of the non-homogeneous Poisson process.
(The minimum time is assumed to be zero.)}

\item{intensityFcn}{intensity function corresponding to rate of arrivals across
time.}

\item{majorizingFcn}{majorizing function.  Default value is NULL,
corresponding to a constant majorizing function that is
1.01 times the maximum value of the intensity function.
May alternatively be provided as a user-specified function,
or as a data frame requiring additional notation as 
either piecewise-constant or piecewise-linear.  See
examples.}

\item{majorizingFcnType}{used to indicate whether a majorizing function that
is provided via data frame is to be interpreted as
either piecewise-constant (\code{"pwc"}) or
piecewise-linear (\code{"pwl"}).  If the majorizing
function is either the default or a user-specified
function (closure), the value of this parameter is
ignored.}

\item{seed}{initial seed for the uniform variates used during
generation.}

\item{maxTrials}{maximum number of accept-reject trials; infinite by default.}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, visual display will be produced.  If FALSE,
generated event times will be returned without visual display.}

\item{showTitle}{if TRUE, display title in the main plot.}

\item{plotDelay}{wait time, in seconds, between plots; -1 (default) for
interactive mode, where the user is queried for input
to progress.}
}
\value{
returns the generated random event times

\description{
This function animates the "thinning" approach the 
             generation of the random event times for a non-homogeneous
             Poisson process with a specified intensity function, given a
             majorizing function that dominates the intensity function.
}
\details{
There are three modes for visualizing Lewis and Shedler's thinning
          algorithm for generating random event times for a non-homogeneous
          Poisson process with a particular intensity function:
           \itemize{
              \item interactive advance (\code{plotDelay = -1}), where 
                 pressing the 'ENTER' key advances to the next step
                 (an accepted random variate) in the algorithm, 
                 typing 'j #' jumps ahead # steps,
                 typing 'q' quits immediately,
                 and typing 'e' proceeds to the end; 
              \item automatic advance (\code{plotDelay} > 0); or
              \item final visualization only (\code{plotDelay = 0}).
           }
           As an alternative to visualizing, event times can be generated
