\description{
Contains various functions to be used for simulation education, including simple Monte Carlo simulation functions, queueing simulation functions, variate generation functions capable of producing independent streams and antithetic variates, functions for illustrating random variate generation for various discrete and continuous distributions, and functions to compute time-persistent statistics. Also contains functions for visualizing: event-driven details of a single-server queue model; a Lehmer random number generator; variate generation via acceptance-rejection; and of generating a non-homogeneous Poisson process via thinning. Also contains two queueing data sets (one fabricated, one real-world) to facilitate input modeling. More details on the use of these functions can be found in Lawson and Leemis (2015) \doi{10.1109/WSC.2017.8248124}, in Kudlay, Lawson, and Leemis (2020) \doi{10.1109/WSC48552.2020.9384010}, and in Lawson and Leemis (2021) \doi{10.1109/WSC52266.2021.9715299}.

\details{
The goal of this package is to facilitate use of R for an introductory
course in discrete-event simulation.

This package contains animation functions for visualizing:
\itemize{
\item event-driven details of a single-server queue model (\code{\link{ssqvis}});
\item a Lehmer random number generator (\code{\link{lehmer}});
\item variate generation via acceptance-rejection
(\code{\link{accrej}});
\item generation of a non-homogeneous Poisson process via thinning
(\code{\link{thinning}}).
}

The package contains variate generators capable of independent streams
(based on Josef Leydold's \code{\link[rstream]{rstream}} package) and antithetic
variates for four discrete and eleven continuous distributions:
\itemize{
\item discrete: \code{\link{vbinom}}, \code{\link{vgeom}},
\code{\link{vnbinom}}, \code{\link{vpois}}
\item continuous: \code{\link{vbeta}}, \code{\link{vcauchy}},
\code{\link{vchisq}}, \code{\link{vexp}}, \code{\link{vgamma}},
\code{\link{vlnorm}}, \code{\link{vlogis}}, \code{\link{vnorm}},
\code{\link{vt}}, \code{\link{vunif}}, \code{\link{vweibull}}
}
All of the variate generators use inversion, and are therefore monotone and
synchronized.

The package contains functions to visualize variate generation for the same
four discrete and eleven continuous distributions:
\itemize{
\item discrete: \code{\link{ibinom}}, \code{\link{igeom}},
\code{\link{inbinom}}, \code{\link{ipois}}
\item continuous: \code{\link{ibeta}}, \code{\link{icauchy}},
\code{\link{ichisq}}, \code{\link{iexp}}, \code{\link{igamma}},
\code{\link{ilnorm}}, \code{\link{ilogis}}, \code{\link{inorm}},
\code{\link{it}}, \code{\link{iunif}}, \code{\link{iweibull}}
}

The package also contains functions that are event-driven simulation
implementations of a single-server single-queue system and of a
multiple-server single-queue system:
\itemize{
\item single-server: \code{\link{ssq}}
\item multiple-server: \code{\link{msq}}
}
Both queueing functions are extensible in allowing the user to provide custom
arrival and service process functions.  As of version 2.0.0, both of these
functions provide animation capability.

The package contains functions that implement Monte Carlo simulation
approaches for estimating probabilities in two different dice games:
\itemize{
\item Galileo's dice problem: \code{\link{galileo}}
\item craps: \code{\link{craps}}
}

The package contains three functions for computing time-persistent statistics:
\itemize{
\item time-average mean: \code{\link{meanTPS}}
\item time-average standard deviation: \code{\link{sdTPS}}
\item time-average quantiles: \code{\link{quantileTPS}}
}

The package also masks two functions from the \code{\link{stats}} package:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{set.seed}}, which explicitly calls the \code{\link{stats}}
version in addition to setting up seeds for the independent streams in
the package;
\item \code{\link{sample}}, which provides capability to use independent
streams and antithetic variates.
}

Finally, the package provides two queueing data sets to facilitate input
modeling:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{queueTrace}}, which contains 1000 arrival times and
1000 service times (all fabricated) for a single-server queueing
system;
\item \code{\link{tylersGrill}}, which contains 1434 arrival times and
110 (sampled) service times corresponding to actual data collected
during one business day at Tyler's Grill at the University of Richmond.
