# simEd 1.0.1

* Fixed a potential platform-dependent error in `quantileTPS`, which relied on 
  `cumsum` to produce an exact value for its last vector entry when summing.

* Includes minor updates to correct formatting issues in some of the pdf/pmf
  equations in help files for variate generator functions and inversion
  visualization functions.
